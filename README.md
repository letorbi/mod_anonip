mod_anonip - Anonymize IP addresses in Apache
=============================================

A simple Apache2 module to anonymize the IP address of any request by a specific number of bytes. It is licensed as open source under the Apache License version 2.0.

The original version of *mod_anonip* is based on [*mod_removeip*](https://github.com/moba/libapache-mod-removeip),
but *mod_anonip* just anonymizes the IP-address by removing a specified number of bytes instead of removing the IP-address completely. This - unlike *mod_removeip* - allows you to preserve the privacy of your visitors, while still being able to log the origin country of a request or to serve website content based on GeoIP.

*This project is still maintained, but since I have a lot of other things on my list, it is unlikely that I will commit something new to the codebase in the forseeable future. However, I will merge pull requests and fix bugs that have been reported.*

Installation
============

First you have to clone the repository and compile the module:

    $ git clone https://github.com/letorbi/mod_anonip
    $ cd mod_anonip/module
    $ make anonip

You might have to install some kind of Apache development package (`libapache2-prefork-dev` or `apache2-threaded-dev` on Ubuntu) to have all tools required for compilation.

After the compilation has finished, you can install and activate the module:

    # make install
    # cd ../conf
    # cp * /etc/apache2/mods-available/
    # a2enmod anonip

After enabling the module you have to restart Apache (`service apache2 restart` on Ubuntu).

Configuration
=============

The module comes with two configuration option, one which defines how many bytes should be masked and the other one which defines if you are behind a reverse proxy:

    AnonipMask = 2
    AnonipBehindProxy = 1
    
The default value for `AnonipMask` is `0`, so `mod_anonip` will do nothing if no configuration exists. The configuration files shipped with the module set `AnonipMask = 2`. Values between 0 and 4 are valid with the following results:

    AnonipMask    Anonymized address
    0             192.168.1.1
    1             192.168.1.0
    2             192.168.0.0
    3             192.0.0.0
    4             0.0.0.0
    [other]       192.168.1.1

The default value for `AnonipBehindProxy` is `0`, so `mod_anonip` will assume you are not behind a reverse proxy and use the IP provided by the currently used connection. If set to `1` it will use the IP provided from the HTTP-Header `X-Forwarded-For` which can be spoofed. Don't use that setting if you don't trust your reverse proxy!!! The configuration files shipped with the module set `AnonipBehindProxy = 1`.

As long, as you mask at least 2 bytes of the IP address, your website will be in accordance with the privacy recommendations of the [Independent Centre for Privacy Protection in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany (ULD)](https://www.datenschutzzentrum.de).
